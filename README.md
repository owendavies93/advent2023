## Advent of Code 2023

### TODO
* Make Day 3 work without modifying the input
   * Just need to fix the edge detection
* Improve Day 10 start node detection
   * Currently just hardcoded for real and example inputs
* Improve Day 17 bounds checking and coordinate extraction
   * Should all be doable in the 1d grid instead of splitting and combining
* Improve Day 22 performance
   * Can sort the input work up through the blocks in z order
* Further improve Day 23 performance
* Implement a version of Day 24 without shelling out to Mathematica
   * Possibly using Perl Z3 bindings? Although that's not much better
